    1. Admit that You are a sinner “As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one” Romans 3:10.

    Someone who is righteous means they are right all the time. Another term for righteous is perfect. This verse of the Bible says that no one is perfect. 
  
    “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.” Romans 3:23 
  
    No one is perfect because everyone has sinned (for example, everyone has told a lie, which is a sin) and everyone falls short of God’s glory.
  
    2. BELIEVE 
    “For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures.” I Corinthians 15:3-4 
  
    You accept the gift of eternal life by believing that Jesus Christ died for your sins, and that He was buried and rose again. YOU must decide where you will spend eternity. Jesus said: 
  
    “I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.” John 14:6

    There is no other way to go to Heaven except through the Lord Jesus Christ. No amount of good works or deeds will earn you a place in Heaven, the Bible is very clear about this: 

“For by grace are ye saved through faith;  and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest  any man should boast.”   Ephesians 2:8-9

3. CONFESS YOUR SINS
Repent and ask Jesus Christ to come into your life as your Saviour and Lord. 

“For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.”   Romans 10:13

4. PRAY WITH SINCERITY AND REMORSE, THE SINNER’S PRAYER, SIMILAR TO THIS:
“Dear God, I thank you for your love and I believe that Jesus gave His life and rose again for me. I know that I am a sinner. I realise that there is nothing that I can do to save myself and go to heaven. I am sorry for my sins. Please cleanse me from my sins and create a new and clean heart in me. I believe in you and I accept you Lord Jesus as my Saviour. I ask that you please help me to live for you. Thank you, God. In Jesus Name. Amen.” 

If you have sincerely made a decision to receive Christ as your Saviour, please let us know. The church would like to offer a discipleship Bible study to help you grow in the Lord.

    description: `What we believe & teach…

      1:      Concerning the Bible:
      
      We believe that the Authorised, King James Version of the Bible containing thirty-nine books of the Old Testament, and twenty-seven books of the New Testament, sixty-six books in all, is the perfect and preserved Word of God.
      
      We accept the historical accounts of the Bible as factual, and interpret Scripture according to the normal rules of grammar.” (i.e. literally).
      
      This book alone is our Absolute Authority in all matters of Doctrine and Practice, Faith and Conduct, without exception.
      
      Psa. 12:6-7; 2 Tim 3:15-17; 2 Pet 1:19-21
      
       
      
      2:      Concerning Dispensations:
      
      We believe that the Bible must be rightly divided in order to be properly understood. We recognise that within the Word of God there are distinguishable Dispensations, in the outworking of God’s purposes. Therefore, we insist that while “All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness,” (2 Tim 3:16) all Scripture does not have a direct application to the Church today. We believe that the current Dispensation is called the Church Age which will end at the Rapture.
      
      2 Tim. 2:15; 3:16; Eph 1:10
      
       
      
      3:      Concerning the One True God:
      
      We believe that there is only One True God and that He is manifest in Three Persons (the Trinity): The Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. These three persons of the Godhead are One, and each has a distinct ministry in God’s relationship with His creation. We believe that God is a spiritual, sovereign, and personal Being who is by nature:
      
      Omniscient: Job 37:16; Psa. 147:4-5; Rom 11:33.
      
      Omnipotent: Job 42:2; Psa. 107:25-29; Rev. 11:17.
      
      Omnipresent: Jer. 23:23-24; Psa. 139:7-9; Acts 17:24-28.
      
      He is the epitome of holiness, righteousness, and wisdom, and is separate from and superior to, His creation.
      
      Gen. 1:1; John 1:1-3; Matt. 3:16-17; I John 5:7.
      
       
      
      4:      Concerning the Lord Jesus Christ:
      
      We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ is the Second Person of the Godhead (Trinity). He is also the eternal Word of God, and the only begotten Son of the Father. He became man through the Virgin Birth. We believe He gave Himself, as the perfect and sinless Lamb of God, to die upon the cross at Calvary and shed His blood for the sins of mankind, suffering sin’s full penalty of divine wrath, in our place. We further insist that He arose bodily from the dead never to die again and ascended into heaven where He is now seated at the right hand of the Majesty on high as the Great High Priest, Advocate, and Intercessor for all those believe in Him.
      
      Isa. 7:14; Luke 1:35; 1 Cor. 15:1-4; 2 Cor. 5:21; 1 Tim. 3:16; Heb. 1:3.
      
       
      
      5:      Concerning the Holy Spirit:
      
      We believe that the Holy Spirit (Holy Ghost) is the Third Person of the Godhead (Trinity), and not an impersonal force or power. We affirm that He is the divine agent in God’s revelation and redemption. He convicts the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment, and regenerates, indwells, baptises, seals, anoints, and comforts all those who believe on and receive the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Saviour. His will is to glorify Christ, and to empower, guide, teach, and fill all believers who will surrender to Him.
      
      John 3:5; 14:16-17,26; 16:7-14; Rom 8:9; 1 Cor. 12:13.
      
      Note: We also believe that the sign gifts, tongues, etc. as described in 1 Cor 12:8-10, ceased with the completion of the New Testament canon. Therefore, we do not subscribe to the Pentecostal and Charismatic interpretations of theses verses, nor their application for the Church today.
      
       
      
      6:      Concerning Creation:
      
      We believe that the eternal Triune God, by the Word of His mouth, supernaturally and intelligently, created everything physical, spiritual, living and inanimate out of nothing, according to His good pleasure. We affirm that, “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.” (Gen1:1) Furthermore, we firmly deny that any forms of organic evolution from one species to another (transmutation) ever occurred.
      
      Gen 1:1; 2:7; Ex 20:11: Jer 32:17; Col 1:16; Heb 11:3
      
       
      
      7:      Concerning Man:
      
      We believe that all men are inherently sinful and lost and under the righteous judgment and wrath of God. Adam, the first man and the head of the human race, wilfully sinned against God by disobedience to His commandment and thereby became separated from His Creator. Man cannot be reformed, rectified, or reversed to God’s satisfaction by his own effort, cunning, merit or righteousness.
      
      We believe that a depraved and sinful nature, and naturally dead spirit, does not hinder a man from being a free moral agent, who is capable and expected of God to will and believe and respond to the admonitions of the Gospel. Men are free to reject God’s graciousness in providing a free salvation. Further, Jesus Christ died for all without exception.
      
      Gen. 1:27; 3:6; Psa 51:5; Isa 64:6; John 5:54; Rom 5:19a; Rom 3:10-12; Eph 2:1b
      
       
      
      8:      Concerning Atonement:
      
      We believe that God’s answer to man’s sinful state is in the substitutionary death, burial, and resurrection, of His only begotten Son, the Lord Jesus Christ on the cross of Calvary, whose sufferings and shed blood have made full atonement for the sins of the whole world. There is none other ground for salvation.
      
      2 Cor 5:18-21; Gal 1:4; Eph 1:7; Col. 1:14; 1 Peter 1:18-20
      
       
      
      9:      Concerning Salvation:
      
      We believe that salvation is a free gift of grace from God. It cannot be merited in whole or in part by any work or virtue of mankind. Salvation can only be received by personal faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and His finished work at Calvary. Also known as being “born-again”, it is an instantaneous and complete operation of the Holy Spirit who indwells a believer the moment he believes. This true believer, who is now in Christ, also receives as a present possession the gift of eternal life together with the following imputed attributes in the eyes of Almighty God:
      
      Perfect righteousness
      
      Perfect holiness
      
      Sonship in God’s family
      
      A new divine nature
      
      Deliverance from eternal condemnation, and,
      
      Every spiritual resource needed for life and godliness.
      
      Furthermore, we insist that no true believer can possibly lose his salvation because it is a free gift, he is in Christ, and Christ is in him, and God has promised that he shall never perish nor be forsaken.
      
      John 1:12,13; 3:2-8; 6:37; Rom 3:23-26; 6:23; 8:1; 2 Cor 5:17; Eph 2:8,9; Titus 3:5–7; Heb 13:5; 1 John 5:1.
      
       
      
      10:    Concerning the Church:
      
      We believe that the Local Church is the assembly of true born-again, and baptised believers in the Lord Jesus Christ. It is the habitation of God through the Spirit with divine appointments for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ.
      
      The Church is a living organism, the head of which is Christ, the body being members who are as lively stones fitly joined together, and compacted by that which every joint supplieth.
      
      We insist that the Local Church is to be autonomous and self-governing, free from interference by any ecclesiastical hierarchy, organisation, or authority. Christ must rule by the Holy Spirit, through His appointed ministers according to the Word of God. However, it is right and proper for likeminded Churches to cooperate with one another, in contending for the faith, and the furtherance of the Gospel.
      
      1 Cor12:28-30; 6:1-4; Eph 1:22-23; 2:21; 4:11-12,16; Col 1:18; Jude 1:3.
      
       
      
      11:    Concerning Ordinances:
      
      We believe that there are but two ordinances decreed by the Lord Jesus Christ to be observed by His Church.
      
      Believers Baptism
      All believers should be baptised by immersion in water, as a sign and testimony of salvation, being symbols of the believer’s identification with Christ’s death, burial, and resurrection to newness of life. Baptism has no merit for salvation; it is a sign of having been saved.
      
      Matt 28:18-20; Acts 8:36-38; 10:47-48; Rom 6:4.
      
       
      
      The Lord’s Supper
      The Lord’s Supper, or Communion, is the solemn partaking of broken unleavened bread and unfermented fruit juice by believers, both the bread and juice being symbols of the body and the shed blood of Jesus Christ, as a memorial of His death until He comes.
      
      Matt 26:26-29; Mark 14:22-25; Luke 22:14-20; 1 Cor 10:16,7; 11:23-26.
      
       
      
      12:    Concerning Satan:
      
      We believe that Satan (the Adversary) is a created being with the ability to appear in different forms. He was not created as such but as Lucifer, the light bearer, he was cast out of heaven when pride, selfish desire, and evil intent was found in him. It was his evil influence that brought about the downfall of man. He now seeks to control unbelievers and to destroy the faith of all believers in the Lord Jesus Christ, but they can resist and overcome him.
      
      Job 1:6; Isa 14:12-15; Ezek 28:12-19; 2 Cor 11:14; Col 1:16; Eph 6:12; 1 Pet 5:8; Jas 4:7; Rev 12:11
      
       
      
      13:    Concerning Christian Responsibility:
      
      We believe that every member of this church has a duty and responsibility to live a clean, holy, and separated life that is not conformed to this world. Not as a means to salvation, but as evidence and as fruit of a new life of righteousness in Christ. Every believer should deny himself, take up his cross, and follow his Saviour’s example, walking as He walked. Furthermore, we believe that every believer has a duty to study the Scriptures, to pray for guidance and wisdom, and to bear the Gospel to a lost and dying world.
      
      Amos 3:3; Luke 9:23-26; Rom 12:1-3; 1 Cor 6:19,20; 1 Pet 1:13-16; 1 John 2:15-17
      
       
      
      14:     Concerning Marriage:
      
      We believe that the Scriptures teach the home was the first institution provided to man by God himself. We believe that marriage is a sacred relationship that is only between a man and a woman (both from birth). Marriage is used as a symbol that describes the relationship between Christ and His bride, the Church.
      
      Gen 1:27; Gen 2:18-25; Eph 5:24-25; Heb 13:4; Rev 19:7-9
      
       
      
      15:    Concerning the Return of Christ:
      
      We believe that the return of the Lord Jesus Christ for His Church is imminent (could occur at any time). Also known as the Rapture, it is the translation of all those who are in Christ, both living and dead, who will be taken instantaneously and without warning.
      
      This will be followed by a seven year period called the Tribulation, such as has never been known upon the earth, when God’s wrath against this sinful world is poured out. The Lord Jesus Christ, together with His saints, will then visibly and gloriously return to earth to destroy the Antichrist and his armies at the climax of the battle of Armageddon. Christ will then establish His throne in Jerusalem and will rule the earth and reign for one thousand years.
      
      John 14:1-3; 1 Cor 15:51-53; Phil 3:20; 1 Thess 4:13-18; Rev 19:11-16.
      
       
      
      16:    Concerning the Future State:
      
      We believe that the redeemed of all ages, having been resurrected and glorified, will be gathered into the presence of the Lord, to worship and serve the Triune God for all eternity in the New Heaven and New Earth.
      
      We believe in the bodily resurrection and judgement of unbelievers of all ages, to take place at the Great White Throne following the millennial reign of Christ. Not having their names recorded in the Lamb’s Book of Life, all are consigned to a lake of fire prepared for the Devil and his angels, there to remain forever.

    description: `Outreach Program:

      The souls of man are important to us, and we know they are precious to God. As a church we recognise our responsibility to carry out the Great Commission, which is to preach and teach the gospel of Jesus Christ to every creature. We have regular outreach in our local community where we go out in public and distribute gospel tracts and witness to people one on one as we have opportunity. We also emphasize our individual responsibility to be a witness for Christ in our daily lives.
      
      Proverbs 11:30
      The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that winneth souls is wise.
      
      Mark 16:15
      And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.
      
      Luke 14:23
      And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.`,
